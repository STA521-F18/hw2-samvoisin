## Backgound Reading

Readings: Chapters 3-4 in Weisberg Applied Linear Regression


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This exercise involves the UN data set from `alr3` package. Install `alr3` and the `car` packages and load the data to answer the following questions adding your code in the code chunks.  Please add appropriate code to the chunks to suppress messages and warnings as needed once you are sure the code is working properly and remove instructions if no longer needed. Figures should have informative captions. Please switch the output to pdf for your final version to upload to Sakai. **Remove these instructions for final submission**


## Exploratory Data Analysis

0.  Preliminary read in the data.  After testing, modify the code chunk so that output, messages and warnings are suppressed.  *Exclude text from final*

```{r data, include = FALSE}
library(alr3)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(gridExtra)
library(car)
data(UN3, package="alr3")
help(UN3)

print_na_cols <- function(df) {
  # name data frame columns containing NA values
  na_cols <- c()
  
  for (name in names(UN3)) {
    if (any(is.na(UN3[name]))) {
      na_cols <- c(na_cols, name)
    }
  }
  print(na_cols)
}

```


1. Create a summary of the data.  How many variables have missing data?  Which are quantitative and which are qualtitative?

Using the `print_na_cols` function I created, we can see that `ModernC`, `Change`, `PPgdp`, `Frate`, `Pop`, and `Fertility` all contain `NA` values. This leaves Purban as the only column with no NA values.

All data is a quantitative measurement in some way. `ModernC`, `Change`, `Frate`, and `Purban` are percentages. `Pop` and `Fertility` are counts. `PPgdp` is a continuous quantitative variable (minus the fact that we can't divide beyond a penny).

```{r Question1}

str(UN3)

print_na_cols(UN3)


```

2. What is the mean and standard deviation of each quantitative predictor?  Provide in a nicely formatted table.

```{r Question2}


col_mean <- round(sapply(UN3, mean, na.rm = TRUE), 2)
col_sd <- round(sapply(UN3, sd, na.rm = TRUE), 2)



kable(
  cbind(col_mean, col_sd),
  col.names = c("Mean", "St. Dev."),
  )

```


3. Investigate the predictors graphically, using scatterplots or other tools of your choice. Create some plots
highlighting the relationships among the predictors. Comment
on your findings regarding trying to predict `ModernC` from the other variables.  Are there potential outliers, nonlinear relationships or transformations that appear to be needed based on your graphical EDA?

As a first step, I used the ggpairs to create a matrix of all of the variables. 

```{r Question3, echo = FALSE, fig.width= 14, fig.height= 10}

UN3 %>%
  na.omit %>%
  ggpairs()
  # create Pop vs ModernC plot
  PopModc <- ggplot(data = , aes(x = Pop, y = ModernC)) + 
    geom_point() +
    ggtitle("Population vs Modern Contraception %") +
    labs(x = "Population (000s)", y = "% of Women w/ Access to Modern Contraception")
  # create PPgdp vs ModernC plot
  PPgdpModc <- ggplot(data = , aes(x = PPgdp, y = ModernC)) + 
    geom_point() +
    ggtitle("Per Capita GDP vs Modern Contraception %") +
    labs(x = "Per Capita GDP (USD)", y = "% of Women w/ Access to Modern Contraception")
  # create ModernC vs Fertility plot
  ModcFert <- ggplot(data = , aes(x = ModernC, y = Fertility)) + 
    geom_point() +
    ggtitle("Modern Contraception % vs Fertility Rate") +
    labs(x = "% of Women w/ Access to Modern Contraception", y = "Expected Fertility Rate (# per female)")
  # create Purban vs ModernC
  PurbModc <- ggplot(data = , aes(x = Purban, y = ModernC)) + 
    geom_point() +
    ggtitle("Urban Populations % vs Modern Contraception %") +
    labs(x = "% of Population in Cities", y = "% of Women w/ Access to Modern Contraception")
  
grid.arrange(PopModc, PPgdpModc, ModcFert, PurbModc, ncol = 2)  
  

```

## Model Fitting

4.  Use the `lm()` function to perform a multiple linear regression with `ModernC` as the response and all other variables as the predictors, using the formula `ModernC ~ .`, where the `.` includes all remaining variables in the dataframe.  Create  diagnostic residual plot from the linear model object and comment on results regarding assumptions.  How many observations are used in your model fitting?

```{r Question4, echo = FALSE}

UN3 %>%
  PreTransModel <- lm(ModernC ~ .)

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(PreTransModel, ask=F)

```

5. Examine added variable plots `car::avPlot` or `car::avPlots`  for your model above. Are there any plots that suggest that transformations are needed for any of the terms in the model? Describe. Is it likely that any of the localities are influential for any of the terms?  Which localities?  Which terms?  

```{r Question5}

```

6.  Using the Box-Tidwell  `car::boxTidwell` or graphical methods find appropriate transformations of the predictor variables to be used as predictors in the linear model.  If any predictors are negative, you may need to transform so that they are non-negative.  Describe your method and  the resulting transformations.


```{r Question6}

```

7. Given the selected transformations of the predictors, select a transformation of the response using `MASS::boxcox` or `car::boxCox` and justify.


```{r Question7}

```

8.  Fit the regression using the transformed variables.  Provide residual plots and added variables plots and comment.  If you feel that you need additional transformations of either the response or predictors, repeat any steps until you feel satisfied.

9. Start by finding the best transformation of the response and then find transformations of the predictors.  Do you end up with a different model than in 8?


```{r}

```

10.  Are there any outliers or influential points in the data?  Explain.  If so, refit the model after removing any outliers and comment on residual plots.


```{r}

```

## Summary of Results

11. For your final model, provide summaries of coefficients with 95% confidence intervals in a nice table with interpretations of each coefficient.  These should be in terms of the original units! 


```{r}

```


12. Provide a paragraph summarizing your final model  and findings suitable for the US envoy to the UN after adjusting for outliers or influential points.   You should provide a justification for any case deletions in your final model


```{r}

```


## Methodology

    
13. Prove that the intercept in the added variable scatter plot will always be zero.  _Hint:  use the fact that if $H$ is the project matrix which contains a column of ones, then $1_n^T (I - H) = 0$.  Use this to show that the sample mean of residuals will always be zero if there is an intercept._


14. For multiple regression with more than 2 predictors, say a full model given by `Y ~ X1 + X2 + ... Xp`   we create the added variable plot for variable `j` by regressing `Y` on all of the `X`'s except `Xj` to form `e_Y` and then regressing `Xj` on all of the other X's to form `e_X`.  Confirm that the slope in a manually constructed added variable plot for one of the predictors  in Ex. 10 is the same as the estimate from your model.
